# Data Acquisition and Preprocessing üìä

## Chosen Dataset: Amazon Books in PDF Format

The selected dataset for this project is sourced from Amazon books in PDF format, focusing on medical literature, particularly related to chest pneumonia. The choice of this dataset provides a diverse range of texts, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the topic.

## Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Data Extraction
To begin, the PDF documents are loaded using the langchain package's PyPDFLoader. This process involves extracting text content from the PDFs, laying the foundation for subsequent analysis.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

documents = PyPDFLoader('documents/book_01.pdf').load()
```

### 2. Text Splitting into Chunks
The extracted documents are then preprocessed using the langchain text_splitter module, specifically the CharacterTextSplitter. This step involves breaking down the texts into manageable chunks to facilitate efficient processing by the deep learning model.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

chunks = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0).split_documents(documents)
```

### 3. Embeddings Generation
Embeddings are created using the langchain.embeddings.openai package, leveraging OpenAI's capabilities. These embeddings serve as numerical representations of the textual content, a crucial step for training the deep learning model.

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

### 4. Database Initialization
The langchain.vectorstores package, specifically Chroma, is employed to initialize the database. This step involves converting the preprocessed text chunks into a format suitable for retrieval during the later stages of the project.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

database = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
```

By executing these preprocessing steps, the dataset is transformed into a structured format suitable for deep learning model training. The subsequent stages of the project will build upon this foundation, focusing on model development, training, and evaluation.


# Model Development and Training ü§ñüîß

### Deep Learning Model Description

The deep learning model developed for this project is a Retrieval Question Answering (QA) system, implemented using the langchain package. This model is designed to analyze and extract information from medical literature, with a specific focus on chest pneumonia. The model consists of two main components:

1. **Retriever**: Utilizing the Chroma database from langchain, the retriever enables efficient searching and retrieval of relevant information from preprocessed text chunks. This component plays a crucial role in selecting pertinent information for the subsequent QA process.

2. **Language Model (LLM)**: The OpenAI language model (LLM) is integrated to provide the language understanding and generation capabilities. The LLM is essential for formulating accurate responses based on the retrieved information.

The Retrieval QA model is instantiated as follows:

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type='stuff',
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
)
```

# Training Process üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 1. Ask Function Definition

To facilitate testing and querying of the model, an `ask` function is defined. This function prompts the model with specific questions related to chest pneumonia and evaluates its responses. The function ensures clear communication of the model's capabilities and limitations.

```python
def ask(question):
    prompt = f"""
    You are an advanced language model designed to analyze and understand medical literature, specifically focused on chest pneumonia. Your goal is to provide comprehensive information on diagnoses and treatment related to chest pneumonia. If the information is available in the documents you have been trained on, please provide detailed and accurate responses. If the information is not present, respond with 'Not mentioned in the documents.'
    Ensure that your answers are based on credible medical sources and provide a clear distinction between known information and unknown information.
    Question: {question}
    """
    output = qa({'query': prompt})
    result, source = output['result'], output['source_documents']

    print(f'Query :  {question}')
    print(f'Result:  {result}')
    if result.find('Not mentioned in the documents') < 0:
        print(f'From  :  {source[0].metadata["source"]}, page number: {source[0].metadata["page"] + 1}')
```

### 2. Testing the Model

The model undergoes rigorous testing with a series of questions related to chest pneumonia, evaluating its ability to provide accurate and informative responses. This iterative testing process allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the model's performance.
