Monitoring of oxygen levels and oxygen delivery guided by oxygen saturation levels can also reduce hospitalization. In children, nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheters have been found to be similarly effective and safe. Clinical signs may not reliably indicate hypoxemia, but vitamin C supplementation in critically ill patients has been associated with lower mortality and reduced respiratory symptom score in one trial. Steroid application has been associated with reduction of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in people with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use in other forms of pneumonia. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor application has not been associated with reduction of mortality in a meta-analysis of 6 studies, and six trials investigating vitamin A showed no significant reduction in mortality or duration of hospital stay.\n",
